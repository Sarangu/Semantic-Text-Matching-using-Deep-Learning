1 : How can I build a recursive function in python? How can I build a recursive function in python? 

2 : How do I do simple user input in python? I'm just playing with input and variables. I'm trying to run a simple function: slope = (y2-y1)/(x2-x1) I'd like to prompt the user to enter y2, y1, x2 and x1. What is the simplest, cleanest way to do this? 

3 : How can I profile a multithread program in Python? I'm developing an inherently multithreaded module in Python, and I'd like to find out where it's spending its time. cProfile only seems to profile the main thread. Is there any way of profiling all threads involved in the calculation? 

4 : How can I return system information in Python? Using Python, how can information such as CPU usage, memory usage (free, used, etc), process count, etc be returned in a generic manner so that the same code can be run on Linux, Windows, BSD, etc? Alternatively, how could this information be returned on all the above systems with the code specific to that OS being run only if that OS is indeed the operating environment? 

5 : How do I parallelize a simple Python loop? This is probably a trivial question, but how do I parallelize the following loop in python? # setup output lists output1 = list() output2 = list() output3 = list() for j in range(0, 10): # calc individual parameter value parameter = j * offset # call the calculation out1, out2, out3 = calc_stuff(parameter = parameter) # put results into correct output list output1.append(out1) output2.append(out2) output3.append(out3) I know how to start single threads in Python but I don't know how to "collect" the results. Multiple processes would be fine too - whatever is easiest for this case. I'm using currently Linux but the code should run on Windows and Mac as-well. What's the easiest way to parallelize this code? 

6 : How can I make a background, non-blocking input loop in python?  So, I have a small console app I'm working on that runs a web-scraping process, and I want to be able to give it console commands mid-execution to control it. To do this I'll need some form of non-blocking keyboard input, as the program may self-terminate due to unexpected errors, and I don't want some thread hanging about and waiting for input when termination has occurred. I have the following already hashed out: import threading import time import queue input_queue = queue.Queue() command_input_event = threading.Event() def kbdListener(): global input_queue, command_input_event kbdInput = '' while kbdInput.lower() not in ['quit', 'exit', 'stop']: kbdInput = input("&gt; ") input_queue.put(kbdInput) command_input_event.set() input_queue.join() listener = threading.Thread(target=kbdListener) listener.start() stop = False while not stop: if command_input_event.is_set(): while not input_queue.empty(): command = input_queue.get() if command.lower() in ['quit', 'exit', 'stop']: print('Stopping') while not input_queue.empty(): input_queue.get() input_queue.task_done() input_queue.task_done() stop = True break else: print('Command "{}" received and processed'.format(command)) input_queue.task_done() My problem is that on the line while not stop: there will be another condition being checked in my program, that determines if the main loop has terminated. If this eventuality was to occur then the main thread would stop, but the background listener thread would still be waiting for input; the situation I'm trying to avoid. I'm not tied in to this approach, so if there is some alternative method for getting a non-blocking input, then I would be open to that advice as well. 

7 : How can I make an EXE file from a Python program? I've used several modules to make EXEs for Python, but I'm not sure if I'm doing it right. How should I go about this, and why? Please base your answers on personal experience, and provide references where necessary. 

8 : How can I create a tmp file in Python? I have this function that references the path of a file: some_obj.file_name(FILE_PATH) where FILE_PATH is a string of the path of a file, i.e. H:/path/FILE_NAME.ext I want to create a file FILE_NAME.ext inside my python script with the content of a string: some_string = 'this is some content' How to go about this? The Python script will be placed inside a Linux box. 

9 : How can I create a copy of an object in Python? I would like to create a copy of an object. I want the new object to possess all properties of the old object (values of the fields). But I want to have independent objects. So, if I change values of the fields of the new object, the old object should not be affected by that. 

10 : How could I optimise this simple python pygame code I've been set a challenge to make a game using pygame ( I am making snake so it should be easy... but I've never used pygame) so using a more efficient language isn't an option.So my question is that I updating the snake grid is too slow and I'm not experienced enough in pygame to fix this, can anyone who is help.Also as a note if I only fill the grid it doesn't clear behind the Snake. Using python 3.8 import pygame import time import random pygame.init() display_width = 800 display_height = 600 display = pygame.display.set_mode((display_width,display_height)) pygame.display.set_caption(&quot;Snake&quot;) pureblue = (0,0,255) purered = (255,0,0) puregreen = (0,255,0) white = (255,255,255) black = (1,1,1) grey = (50,50,50) darkgrey = (25,25,25) clock = pygame.time.Clock() snake_block = 10 snake_speed = 30 font_style = pygame.font.SysFont(None, 50) def drawGrid(): blockSize = 10 for x in range(display_width): for y in range(display_height): rect = pygame.Rect(x*blockSize, y*blockSize,blockSize, blockSize) pygame.draw.rect(display, darkgrey, rect, 1) def message(msg, colour): text = font_style.render(msg, True, colour) display.blit(text, [display_width/2, display_height/2]) def SnakeGameLoop(): game_over = False X = display_width/2 Y = display_height/2 X_change = 0 Y_change = 0 while not game_over: for event in pygame.event.get(): if event.type == pygame.QUIT: game_over = True if event.type == pygame.KEYDOWN: if event.key == pygame.K_LEFT: X_change = -10 Y_change = 0 elif event.key == pygame.K_RIGHT: X_change = 10 Y_change = 0 elif event.key == pygame.K_UP: X_change = 0 Y_change = -10 elif event.key == pygame.K_DOWN: X_change = 0 Y_change = 10 if X &gt;= display_width or X &lt; 0 or Y &gt;= display_height or Y &lt; 0: game_over = True X += X_change Y += Y_change display.fill(grey) drawGrid() pygame.draw.rect(display,puregreen,[X,Y,10,10]) pygame.display.update() clock.tick(15) message(&quot;You lost&quot;, purered) pygame.display.update() time.sleep(2) pygame.quit() quit() SnakeGameLoop()

3 : How can I know the id of a JSF component so I can use in Javascript Problem: Sometimes you will want to access a component from javascript with getElementById, but id's are generated dynamically in JSF, so you need a method of getting an objects id. I answer below on how you can do this. Original Question: I want to use some code like below. How can I reference the inputText JSF component in my Javascript? &lt;html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xmlns:h="http://java.sun.com/jsf/html" xmlns:f="http://java.sun.com/jsf/core"&gt; &lt;head&gt; &lt;title&gt;Input Name Page&lt;/title&gt; &lt;script type="javascript" &gt; function myFunc() { // how can I get the contents of the inputText component below alert("Your email address is: " + document.getElementById("emailAddress").value); } &lt;/script&gt; &lt;/head&gt; &lt;h:body&gt; &lt;f:view&gt; &lt;h:form&gt; Please enter your email address:&lt;br/&gt; &lt;h:inputText id="emailAddresses" value="#{emailAddresses.emailAddressesStr}"/&gt; &lt;h:commandButton onclick="myFunc()" action="results" value="Next"/&gt; &lt;/h:form&gt; &lt;/f:view&gt; &lt;/h:body&gt; &lt;/html&gt; Update: this post Client Identifiers in JSF2.0 discusses using a technique like: &lt;script type="javascript" &gt; function myFunc() { alert("Your email address is: " + document.getElementById("#{myInptTxtId.clientId}").value); } &lt;/script&gt; &lt;h:inputText id="myInptTxtId" value="backingBean.emailAddress"/&gt; &lt;h:commandButton onclick="myFunc()" action="results" value="Next"/&gt; Suggesting that the attribute id on the inputText component creates an object that can be accessed with EL using #{myInptTxtId}, in the above example. The article goes on to state that JSF 2.0 adds the zero-argument getClientId() method to the UIComponent class. Thereby allowing the #{myInptTxtId.clientId} construct suggested above to get the actual generated id of the component. Though in my tests this doesn't work. Can anyone else confirm/deny. The answers suggested below suffer from drawback that the above technique doesn't. So it would be good to know if the above technique actually works. 

4 : How can I compile and deploy a java class at runtime? I am in the process of writing a rule engine that performs simple assignments as determined by conditional constructs. It is a prerequisite of the project that the rules be in XML format. I have modeled my XML schema to resemble simple code blocks. I wish to parse the XML and to then transform it into Java code. I then wish to compile (and run) this code at runtime. Doing so would mean that my rule engine no longer acts as an interpreter but executes native Java Byte Code. I have figured out the parsing stage and more or less the Java code generation phase. I would now like to figure out the last phase - the compile at runtime phase. Following this thread: Compile to java bytecode (without using Java) I have become aware of the following possible solutions: ASM BCEL Trove I would love a comparison of these as well as other suggestions for solving the Java compile at runtime phase.

6 : How can I set the compileOptions for my Gradle Java plugin? I want to set the -parameters command on my gradle build so that I can use reflection to access the name of the parameters. It seems like I should be doing this with the following closure. compileJava { compileOptions { compilerArgs &lt;&lt; '-parameters' } } But compileOptions is listed as read-only, and when I look at the source code there's no setter. https://gradle.org/docs/current/dsl/org.gradle.api.tasks.compile.JavaCompile.html#org.gradle.api.tasks.compile.JavaCompile:options How am I suppose to be able to tell the javac compiler what args to use in Gradle?

==========================
1 : Top K indices of a multi-dimensional tensor I have a 2D tensor and I want to get the indices of the top k values. I know about pytorch's topk function. The problem with pytorch's topk function is, it computes the topk values over some dimension. I want to get topk values over both dimensions. For example for the following tensor a = torch.tensor([[4, 9, 7, 4, 0], [8, 1, 3, 1, 0], [9, 8, 4, 4, 8], [0, 9, 4, 7, 8], [8, 8, 0, 1, 4]]) pytorch's topk function will give me the following. values, indices = torch.topk(a, 3) print(indices) # tensor([[1, 2, 0], # [0, 2, 1], # [0, 1, 4], # [1, 4, 3], # [1, 0, 4]]) But I want to get the following tensor([[0, 1], [2, 0], [3, 1]]) This is the indices of 9 in the 2D tensor. Is there any approach to achieve this using pytorch? 

2 : How to find the top k values in a 2-D tensor in tensorflow Is there a way to find the top k values in a 2-D tensor in Tensorflow? I can use tf.nn.top_k for a 1-D tensor but it cannot work with a 2-D tensor. I have a 2-D tensor with unknown size, is there a way to find the top k values and their indices? Thanks a lot. 

3 : How to find a subarray with minimum k length and maximum sum? The subarray contains both positive and negative numbers. You have to find a maximum sum subarray such that the length of the sub-array is greater than or equal to k. Here is my code in c++ using Kadane's algorithm. #include &lt;iostream&gt; using namespace std; int main(){ int n,k; cin &gt;&gt; n &gt;&gt; k; int array[n]; int sum = 0; int maxsum = 0; int beststarts[n]; for(int i = 0;i &lt; n; i++){ cin &gt;&gt; array[i]; } for(int i = 0;i &lt; k-1;i ++){ sum = sum+array[i]; beststarts[i] = 0; } for(int i = k-1;i &lt; n; i++){ //best end search with min length; sum = sum+array[i]; int testsum = sum; if(i &gt; 0){ beststarts[i] = beststarts[i-1]; } for(int j = beststarts[i] ;i-j &gt; k-1;j ++){ testsum = testsum - array[j]; if(testsum &gt; sum){ beststarts[i] = j+1; sum = testsum; } } if(sum &gt; maxsum){ maxsum = sum; } } cout &lt;&lt; maxsum; return 0; } My code is working fine but it is very slow, and i cant think of any ways to improve my code. I have also read this question Find longest subarray whose sum divisible by K but that is not what i want, the length can be greater than k also. 

4 : How to find the kth largest element in an unsorted array of length n in O(n)? I believe there's a way to find the kth largest element in an unsorted array of length n in O(n). Or perhaps it's "expected" O(n) or something. How can we do this? 

5 : how would you sort n sorted lists with average length K in O(n*log K) time? how would you sort n sorted lists with average length K in O(n*log K) time? 

6 : how to determine if the kth largest element of the heap is greater than x Consider a binary heap containing n numbers (the root stores the greatest number). You are given a positive integer k &lt; n and a number x. You have to determine whether the kth largest element of the heap is greater than x or not. Your algorithm must take O(k) time. You may use O(k) extra storage 

7 : Tensorflow, how to multiply a 2D tensor (matrix) by corresponding elements in a 1D vector I have a 2D matrix M of shape [batch x dim], I have a vector V of shape [batch]. How can I multiply each of the columns in the matrix by the corresponding element in the V? That is: I know an inefficient numpy implementation would look like this: import numpy as np M = np.random.uniform(size=(4, 10)) V = np.random.randint(4) def tst(M, V): rows = [] for i in range(len(M)): col = [] for j in range(len(M[i])): col.append(M[i][j] * V[i]) rows.append(col) return np.array(rows) In tensorflow, given two tensors, what is the most efficient way to achieve this? import tensorflow as tf sess = tf.InteractiveSession() M = tf.constant(np.random.normal(size=(4,10)), dtype=tf.float32) V = tf.constant([1,2,3,4], dtype=tf.float32) 

8 : Algorithm - How to find the Kt'h element in O(K) and with build O(n) I need to find the K element in O(k) with input of an array with an unordered n elements with the following requirements: 1) The build can be O(n) (you can build any data structure you want with the given array) 2) find the k element in O(k) 

9 : Get indices of top N values in 2D numpy ndarray or numpy matrix I have an array of N-dimensional vectors. data = np.array([[5, 6, 1], [2, 0, 8], [4, 9, 3]]) In [1]: data Out[1]: array([[5, 6, 1], [2, 0, 8], [4, 9, 3]]) I'm using sklearn's pairwise_distances function to compute a matrix of distance values. Note that this matrix is symmetric about the diagonal. dists = pairwise_distances(data) In [2]: dists Out[2]: array([[ 0. , 9.69535971, 3.74165739], [ 9.69535971, 0. , 10.48808848], [ 3.74165739, 10.48808848, 0. ]]) I need the indices corresponding to the top N values in this matrix dists, because these indices will correspond the pairwise indices in data that represent vectors with the greatest distances between them. I have tried doing np.argmax(np.max(distances, axis=1)) to get the index of the max value in each row, and np.argmax(np.max(distances, axis=0)) to get the index of the max value in each column, but note that: In [3]: np.argmax(np.max(dists, axis=1)) Out[3]: 1 In [4]: np.argmax(np.max(dists, axis=0)) Out[4]: 1 and: In [5]: dists[1, 1] Out[5]: 0.0 Because the matrix is symmetric about the diagonal, and because argmax returns the first index it finds with the max value, I end up with the cell in the diagonal in the row and column matching where the max values are stored, instead of the row and column of the top values themselves. At this point I'm sure I could write some more code to find the values I'm looking for, but surely there is an easier way to do what I'm trying to do. So I have two questions that are more or less equivalent: How can I find the indices corresponding to the top N values in a matrix, or , how can I find the vectors with the top N pairwise distances from an array of vectors? 

10 : A^k for matrix multiplication in R? Suppose A is some square matrix. How can I easily exponentiate this matrix in R?

Trial 1 set.seed(10) t(matrix(rnorm(16),ncol=4,nrow=4)) -&gt; a for(i in 1:2){a &lt;- a %*% a} Trial 2 a &lt;- t(matrix(c(0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0),nrow=4)) i &lt;- diag(4) (function(n) {if (n&lt;=1) a else (i+a) %*% Recall(n-1)})(10)
